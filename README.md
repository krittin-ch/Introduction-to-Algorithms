# Introduction-to-Algorithms

## Overview
This repository is based on **_Introduction to Algorithms_** by **Thomas H. Cormen**, **Charles E. Leiserson**, **Ronald L. Rivest**, and **Clifford Stein**.

The book encompasses **6 main chapters**:
1. Foundations
- The Role of Algorithms in Computing
- Getting Started
- Characterizing Running Times
- Divide-and-Conquer
- Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms   
2. Sorting and Order Statistics
3. Data Structures
4. Advanced Design and Analysis Techniques
5. Advanced Data Structures
6. Graph Algorithms


However, this repository focuses on the practical implementations of the following two chapters:

Chapter 2: Predicate Logic
- This section leverages Alloy, a tool for modeling and analysis, to implement predicate logic. Alloy's advantages allow us t0 study intricate systems and create instances for examination and study of logical restrictions and properties.


Chapter 3: Verification by Model Checking
- This section utilizes NuSMV, a tool for model checking, particularly in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). NuSMV is an excellent tool for enabling system behaviors, detecting faults during the design phase, and evaluating finite state systems against temporal logic specifications.
